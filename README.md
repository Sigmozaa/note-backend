YouTube AI Notes – Backend

Description:
A backend application that supports generating notes from YouTube videos using AI. It accepts YouTube video links and passes them to the AI ​​to generate notes, and returning the completed notes to the frontend.

Technologies:
• Node.js
• Express.js
• dotenv (for storing API keys locally)

Features:
• REST API endpoints for the frontend
• Calling AI from the backend using a key in .env
• Validation and error handling
• Ability to scale for future features


The backend in this project uses Google's API to generate notes. The API has now been changed and the project needs updating, but the frontend and backend logic demonstrate the application's structure and AI integration.
